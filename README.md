# task6-password-strength-evaluation

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task was to create multiple passwords with varying complexity, test them on a password strength checker, and analyze the results to learn best practices for strong password creation.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com) – For password strength analysis.
- Web browser for research.

---

## 🔍 Steps Followed
1. Created five different passwords ranging from weak to very strong.
2. Tested each password on [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com).
3. Recorded the score, complexity rating, and feedback.
4. Analyzed which factors increased or decreased password strength.
5. Researched common password attacks and security recommendations.

## 📊 Password Test Results

| Password (partially masked)     | Score  | Complexity   | Notes |
|---------------------------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| `apple123`                      | 37%    | Weak         | Short, lacks symbols, predictable pattern. |
| `Apple2024`                     | 78%    | Strong       | Good length and mix of letters/numbers, no symbols. |
| `P@ssW0rd#Sec2025!`              | 100%   | Very Strong  | Excellent length, mixed characters, symbols, and numbers. |
| `Ele!Va33$Te@LAbs#04`            | 100%   | Very Strong  | Complex with multiple symbol and number placements. |
| `PurpleSky$7tasksix!DoIt`        | 100%   | Very Strong  | Long passphrase, mixed characters, symbols, and numbers. |

## 📖 Key Learnings
- **Length matters**: Longer passwords are significantly harder to crack.
- **Mix it up**: Combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increases security.
- **Avoid predictability**: Common words, dates, or patterns reduce strength.
- **Passphrases work well**: Multiple unrelated words create a strong but memorable password.

---

## ⚠️ Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** – Attempts all possible combinations until the correct one is found.
- **Dictionary Attack** – Uses lists of common words and previously leaked passwords.
- **Credential Stuffing** – Reuses stolen credentials from previous breaches.
- **Phishing** – Tricks users into revealing their passwords.

---

## ✅ Best Practices
- Use **at least 12–16 characters** for each password.
- Mix **letters, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoid using **personal information**.
- Use a **password manager** to generate and store complex passwords.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication** for better protection.
